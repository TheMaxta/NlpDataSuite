________________________________________
For anesthesia contracts, the QNXT application usually pays claims based on a set dollar amount per billed unit and time units. When claims are adjudicated, the QNXT application converts anesthesia to units as configured by lines of business and place of service Anesthesia Conversion Rules. Converting anesthesia time to units, the number of minutes in the Anesthesia Minutes field on the Claim's Service tab is divided by the number of minutes entered in the Number of Minutes Per Unit field. The QNXT application also supports Anesthesia pricing modifiers. More importantly, the configuration rules specify which option to use when rounding anesthesia units.
The QNXT application has a DME term type that supports the requirement of paying DME and DMEPOS (Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies), DME region-based fees, network discounts, and rental-to-purchase options.
The QNXT application supports orthopedic supplies, prosthetics, and injectables. Pricing can be determined by surgeon or assistant surgeons.

Title: Describe your solutions capability to price claims with modifiers and multiple modifiers on the same detail line.
RFP Name  Date: Alliant RFQ - October 2017 - TranZform-QNXT-NetworX

________________________________________
The QNXT Contract module can price claims with modifiers and multiple modifiers on the same claim detail line with an explanation of the computation based on a percentage of the allowable fee to keep the final contract paid from exceeding the billed charge. The QNXT application’s tier modifier discount calculation logic determines the lesser of the contract amount and the billed amount by comparing the initial contract paid amount prior to applying lesser of logic. Users can configure to determine when “lessor of” logic should be invoked during claim adjudication. The Edit steps will identify claim payments accordingly for ease of auditing and validation purposes.
Discounts for multiple surgeries, as well as for other multiple modifiers, often vary by provider contract. <<clientShort>> can easily configure modifier discounts and modifier discount groups which can then be assigned to lines of business, networks, or provider contracts. Sequentially tiered discounts can be created for the same modifier. In addition, this feature has built-in checks to prevent the entry of overlapping tiers, duplicate entries, and entries where the tier start is greater than the tier end.

##INCLUDE THE YELLOW HIGHLIGHTED PHRASES ONLY IF YOU ARE PROPOSING ENGAGEPROVIDER/MEMBER.
The QNXT application includes a standard provider directory template. In addition, users can use ad hoc reporting to extract the necessary data (e.g., zip codes, counties, and districts) to produce provider directories and export the data to third-party systems or our EngageProvider and EngageMember portals. Updates to the web portal directory occur on a user-defined basis.
The QNXT provider record resides in the relational SQL database and is the single source of provider data throughout the enterprise. It enables creation of the provider directory using the provider’s demographic information, affiliations, pay-to affiliations, credentialed status, and related data such as specialty and sub-specialties, which link records for a 360-degree view in QNXT and the EngageProvider portal.

________________________________________
The provider record resides in the relational SQL database and is the single source of provider data throughout the enterprise, supporting claims processing, service authorization, case management, and member assignments for primary care providers (PCPs). In addition, the provider record enables creation of the provider directory using the provider’s demographic information, affiliations, pay-to affiliations, participation status (par, non-par, or out of area), credentialed status, and related data such as specialty and sub-specialties.
The processes for claim adjudication and authorization validation evaluate the provider’s participation status to determine contracted rate allowances, benefit determination, cost of share, and member responsibility.

The QNXT application provides a couple of options for provider mass updates. First, provider import functionality allows mass updates to specific providers within a network or group. Second, users can manually update a group, network address, or other data elements. The update can be performed in one area and cascade down to all other providers associated with that group or network.
